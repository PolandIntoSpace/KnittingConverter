# TODO!: Use console input to define if only two (1) or three colors (2) are used, or the colors have to be switched (3) (set by user)

# TODO!: (2) Extract the information (three colors) and use them for new function ConvertTriple() (doesn't exist yet)
# TODO!: (3) Switch colors. Works easy for binary, but how for triple??
